various collections of CSS snippits that come in handy on a day-to-day basis.

all off the snippits are things that i created and often re-use so its handy to have them here, the code might be a bit 'un-clean' as its mainly in a raw, thinking, stage at the moment, mostly it gets cleaned with the rest of it!

enjoy.
